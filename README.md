# radio-modem
Unofficial website redesign of ITU's Radio Modem.

Modem is a student driven radio and podcast organisation at IT-Univerity Copenhagen.

Currently (Jan 2019) their content is split, posting podcasts on [mixcloud](https://mixcloud.com/RadioModem/) and livestreaming on their [own site](https://radiomodem.dk).
The reason for my redesign is centralizing the content to a single website by utilizing the [Mixcloud API](https://api.mixcloud.com).

This project is my first time using an api and I'm overall very new to webdevelopment âœŒ

### known bugs and backlog

- Security vuln: no escaped strings

- Serve content from api and webscrape(episode descriptions) with serverside code instead of frontend js
- Design individual episode pages along with full mixcloud widget redesign
- Design and implement livestream page
