Unofficial redesign of ITU's Radio Modem website
Modem is a student driven radio and podcast organisation at IT-Univerity Copenhagen.

Currently (Jan 2019) their content is split, posting podcasts on mixcloud and livestreaming on their own site.
The reason for my redesign is centralizing the content to a single website.
This redesign project is my first time using an api and I'm overall very new to webdevelopment âœŒ
