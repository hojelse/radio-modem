# radio-modem
Unofficial website redesign of ITU's Radio Modem.

Modem is a student driven radio and podcast organisation at IT-Univerity Copenhagen.

Currently (Jan 2019) their content is split, posting podcasts on [mixcloud](https://mixcloud.com/RadioModem/) and livestreaming on their [own site](https://radiomodem.dk).
The reason for my redesign is centralizing the content to a single website by utilizing the [Mixcloud API](https://api.mixcloud.com).

This project is my first time using an api and I'm overall very new to webdevelopment âœŒ

### known bugs and backlog

- Current security issue: no escaped strings
- Get podcast episode descriptions (can't find in api)
- Make 'more' button work
- Creating a new html file for each episode
- Visual indication about how long the audio preview is
